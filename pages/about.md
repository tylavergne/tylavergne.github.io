### Ty Lavergne

Hello! My name is Ty Lavergne, and I am an Apple iOS App Developer. I received my Apple Developer Certificate in January 2019. I currently have two apps on the Apple iOS App Store with more apps to come soon. For more information on my apps, [view my apps.]({{ site.baseurl }}/apple-apps)

I hope you enjoy the apps that I worked so hard to make.

Sincerely,

Ty Lavergne
