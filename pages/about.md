### About Ty Lavergne

Hello! My name is Ty Lavergne, and I am an Apple Developer. I have always had a fascination with technology. If my apps are useful for even at least one user, my developer goal would be achieved. 

I have always wanted to be an Apple Developer for as long as I can remember. I told my mom to buy me a membership to the Apple Developer Program for a Christmas present; I officially became an Apple Developer on December 25, 2018. I wanted to post an app to the store, but I wasn’t sure what creation I wanted to share with the world. I decided on letting my first app on the store be an app for the school, called Buna Cougar Stickers. Buna Cougar Stickers was a sticker pack for sending stickers on iMessage and officially went live on January 12, 2019.

I then set a goal for myself to get an app on the App Store that actually ran on my own code. The app that I put my attention towards was Words, soon to be called Word Wall Words, that I began developing on September 17, 2018. I love watching my apps be successful and being used in places where it can cause real and impactful change; therefore, I decided for one of my first apps to be educational and used in classrooms, particularly in my mom’s classroom. The purpose behind Words was to be a flashcard app for sight words in early elementary classrooms. The app began with all the words being hardcoded in the app, not giving the user the functionality of adding their own words. After adding the ability for users to add their own words to the app, I officially sent the app to Apple on January 13, 2019, and it got approved and published on January 14, 2019, two days after Buna Cougar Stickers.

Last summer, there were many changes that I knew needed to be made to the app. I began developing Version 3.0, also known as the Back to School Extravaganza Update, on July 11, 2019. I added the functionality for multiple word lists, an in-app tutorial, a complete under-the-hood remodel, and the ability for the app to speak the words. The Back to School Extravaganza update was published on July 26, 2019.

After the app sales soared, I began receiving requests to add more accessibility features. I added the ability to change the color of the flashcards and the words on them in Version 3.1. I then added accessibility features to adapt the text on the app to sizes that the users preferred and used across the rest of the system in Version 3.1.1.

I am incredibly blessed for the ability to share my apps, as well as my future apps, with the world. For more information on my apps, [view my apps.]({{ site.baseurl }}/apple-apps "My Apps")

I hope you enjoy the apps that I have worked so hard to make.
