### About Ty Lavergne

Hello! My name is Ty Lavergne, and I am an Apple Developer. I have always had a fascination with technology. Ever since I can remember, I have always dreamed of becoming an Apple Developer. If my apps are useful for even at least one user, my developer goal would be achieved. 

I became an official Apple Developer on December 25, 2018. My first app, Buna Cougar Stickers, went live on January 12, 2019. Two days later, my second app, Word Wall Words, also went live on the Apple App Store. I am incredibly blessed for the ability to share my apps, as well as my future apps, with the world. For more information on my apps, [view my apps.]({{ site.baseurl }}/apple-apps "My Apps")

I hope you enjoy the apps that I have worked so hard to make.

All things possible,

Ty Lavergne
