I want to thank the Adkins Crew for creating this brilliant idea and deciding to share it with me to pursue and deliver to the App Store.

I would also like to thank Elise Griffin for delivering this idea to me.

I also want to thank my sister, Jessi Lavergne, for drawing the icons used across the app.

All things possible,
Ty Lavergne
Apple Developer
