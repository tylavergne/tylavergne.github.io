# Word Wall Words

-----------------

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you enter Flashcard Mode?

From the Main Menu, click Flashcards at the top of the screen. The words that you have either entered or the default words are then randomized and the first word in the series will be in the center of the screen.

### While in Flashcard Mode, how do you advance to the next word?

Once you are in Flashcard Mode, all you have to do is click anywhere on the screen and the word will advance to the next one in the series.

### Why does the words in Flashcard Mode advance automatically and not allow me to advance the words on click.

A possible reason that this would happen is because Automatic Word Switcher is turned on. To turn off Automatic Word Switcher, go to Main Menu > Settings and turn off Automatic Word Switcher switch. If this does not resolve the issue, please Contact Me.

### What is Automatic Word Switcher and how do I enable it?

Automatic Word Switcher is a new feature that has been added to Word Wall Words that will automatically switch the word in Flashcard Mode after about 5 seconds. To turn off/on Automatic Word Switcher, go to Main Menu > Settings and turn off/on the Automatic Word Switcher switch.

### Can I add my own words to Word Wall Words?

Yes! Go to the Main Menu and click Edit Words. This will present all the saved words and allow you to add more if you wish.

### What options do I have to delete saved words?

You can either delete individual words by swiping left on the Edit Words/Manage Words Menu. If you wish to delete all the individual words at once, click the Erase all Words button from the Settings Menu.
