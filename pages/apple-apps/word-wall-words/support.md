# Word Wall Words

-----------------

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you enter Flashcard Mode?

From the Main Menu, click Flashcards at the top of the screen. The words that you have either entered or the default words are then randomized and the first word in the series will be in the center of the screen.

### While in Flashcard Mode, how do you advance to the next word?

Once you are in Flashcard Mode, all you have to do is click anywhere on the screen and the word will advance to the next one in the series. However, if you are in Automatic Word Switcher, then the app will advance itself.

### Why does the words in Flashcard Mode advance automatically and not allow me to advance the words on click?

A possible reason that this would happen is because Automatic Word Switcher is turned on. To turn off Automatic Word Switcher, go to Main Menu > Settings and turn off Automatic Word Switcher switch. If this does not resolve the issue, please Contact Me.

### What is Automatic Word Switcher and how do I enable it?

Automatic Word Switcher is a new feature that has been added to Word Wall Words that will automatically switch the word in Flashcard Mode after about 5 seconds. To turn off/on Automatic Word Switcher, go to Main Menu > Settings and turn off/on the Automatic Word Switcher switch.

### Can I add my own word lists to Word Wall Words?

Yes! Go to the Main Menu and click Edit Lists. This will present all the saved lists and allow you to the ablilty to add lists if you wish.

### What options do I have to delete saved word lists?

You can either delete individual word lists, weeks, or words by swiping left on the item in Edit/Manage Words Menu. If you wish to delete all the saved data at once, click the Erase all Word Lists button from the Settings Menu.
