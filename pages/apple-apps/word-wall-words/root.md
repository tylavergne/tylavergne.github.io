Word Wall Words is an app that allow users to flip through more than 50 words that any kindergartner or first grader would need to know! This app is designed by the help of first grade teachers for them to use to help their students learn common words in a fun way!

To get started, click on Word Lists. This will show the word lists that have been saved to the device. Once you click on a Word List, it will show all the weeks that are inside the Word Lists. If you click on the info button, it will show the words that are inside the week. If you click on a week instead of the info button, the app will return to the Main Menu and show that the week you have selected is the selected week. Users can also change, edit, add, or delete words or word lists if necessary by navigating to where they want to make changes inside Word Lists and either clicking the Add Button or swiping left to delete it.

You can turn on Word Grouping, which while in Flashcards, will combine the current week with the previous weeks. For example, if you have selected Week 5, Word Grouping will include Week 1 through Week 5 in Flashcards.
