## I [octocat] Code 2.0 Shirt

![I Code 2.0 Shirt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/4802/products/i-octocat-code_600x600.png?v=1520399372)

In the beginning, there was the I :octocat: code shirt. Games were changed, paradigms were shifted, and codes were octocatted.

Then time passed. New games were created. New paradigms appeared. And yet, the codes were still octocatted in the same old fashioned way.

BUT NO LONGER.

Now you can octocat code in a brand new way: 2.0. Printed on American Apparel tri-blend t-shirts, this beauty will enable you to octocat code in the most cutting edge of fashions. While you're at it, buy a couple. You never know who is likely to tear this shirt off your back in a deranged fit of jealousy.

## Invertocat 2.0 Shirt

![Invertocat 2.0 Shirt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/4802/products/invertocat_600x600.png?v=1520399398)

Invertocat is in stealth mode and is ready for primetime, now with a stylish, more visible front logo.

Everything else is the same as the last edition. Same American Apparel tri-blend shirt (sizing is more normal to AA this time). Still stylish as hell, and still SOFTER THAN ISH. Best to buy three, because your friends will steal this right off your back. And it's still not summer yet, so you might get cold. Unless you live in the Southern hemisphere, in which case I salute you, upside down person.
