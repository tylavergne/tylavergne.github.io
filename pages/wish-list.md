## I [octocat] Code 2.0 Shirt

![I Code 2.0 Shirt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0051/4802/products/i-octocat-code_600x600.png?v=1520399372)

In the beginning, there was the I :octocat: code shirt. Games were changed, paradigms were shifted, and codes were octocatted.

Then time passed. New games were created. New paradigms appeared. And yet, the codes were still octocatted in the same old fashioned way.

BUT NO LONGER.

Now you can octocat code in a brand new way: 2.0. Printed on American Apparel tri-blend t-shirts, this beauty will enable you to octocat code in the most cutting edge of fashions. While you're at it, buy a couple. You never know who is likely to tear this shirt off your back in a deranged fit of jealousy.
