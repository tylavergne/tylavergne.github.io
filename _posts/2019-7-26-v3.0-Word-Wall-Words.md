It is Back to School Season, so I decided to go a little crazy on this extravaganza update! This update is a result of weeks of hard work trying to make everything just perfect!

- The user interface has been completely redesigned from scratch.
- The app icon has been changed.
- Under the hood of the whole app has been changed for better performance.
- An incredible full screen presenting feature has been added. While presenting, swipe up and down to enter and leave full screen. Words cannot say how cool full screen presenting is!
- A Tutorial has been added to show you around the app and get you comfortable to the new design.
- Important details about the app have been added to the Settings app.
- Accessibility features have been added! If you have any Accessibility features turned on in Settings, Word Wall Words will now adjust!
- Speech features have been added! You can go to Settings > Speech Options to turn on the features. Then, when presenting words, Word Wall Words will say the words according to your preference.
- Bugs have fixed and performance changes have been made across the app.
