I hope school is going smoothly for everyone! In this update, I added a feature long needed. You can now add your own time to the Automatic Word Switcher! This means that the app can now automatically switch between the words at a pace that works best for your kids! I hope you enjoy!

If you love my app, I would be thrilled if you would leave me a rating or review on the App Store! I love to hear feedback from y’all!

Thanks for using Word Wall Words!
