I hope school is going smoothly for everyone! In this update, I fixed a bug in Settings that would result in the app crashing.

If you love my app, I would be thrilled if you would leave me a rating or review on the App Store! I love to hear feedback from yâ€™all!

Thanks for using Word Wall Words!
