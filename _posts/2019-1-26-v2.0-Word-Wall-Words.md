- Added Word Lists. Word Lists allows you to save multiple lists and pick between a certain list at a time.
- Added Weeks. This will enable you to be able to add new words every week and switch between them quickly.
- Added Word Grouping. While in Flashcards, Word Grouping will combine the current week with the previous weeks. For example, if you have selected Week 5, Word Grouping will include Week 1 through Week 5 in Flashcards.
